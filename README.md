# Spam Classification NLP Prediction Model Readme

## Overview
This repository contains a Natural Language Processing (NLP) prediction model for spam classification. The goal of this project is to predict whether a given message is spam or not using various NLP techniques and libraries.

## Features
The model leverages the following NLP libraries and techniques:
 **Punkt Tokenizer**: This tokenizer is used for sentence tokenization, breaking text into sentences. It helps in preprocessing the text data for further analysis.
* **Stopwords Removal**: Common stopwords are removed from the text to reduce noise in the data. Stopwords are words that do not contribute much to the meaning of a sentence.
* **Lemmatization**: Lemmatization is employed to reduce words to their base or root form. It helps in standardizing words and simplifying the text for analysis.
* **Stemming**: Stemming is another technique used to reduce words to their root form, but it is a more aggressive approach compared to lemmatization. It involves removing prefixes or suffixes from words.

## Usage
To use the spam classification model, follow these steps:
1. Clone the Repository:
2. Install Dependencies:
3. Run the Streamlit file (app.py)
   * a. Input:
   Provide the message you want to classify as spam or not when prompted.
   * b. Output:
   The model will output whether the given message is classified as spam or not.
